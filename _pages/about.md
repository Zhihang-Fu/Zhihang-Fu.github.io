# Reasearch Interest &#124; 研究方向

I am currently focusing on the application and research on Large Language Models, particularly aiming to better address challenges such as **knowledge injection, hallucination, and alignment through data synthesis**. In terms of the practical implementation of LLM in industry, my team has engaged in various domain-specific practices.  
I am recruiting **self-motivated research interns and full-time employees** in LLM research and applications. Feel free to contact me if you are interested.
<!--, including but not limited to OlympicGPT for Olympic commentators, overseas sovereign LLMs, and taxation assistant. -->

我当前从事LLM应用算法及基础研究，致力于通过数据合成方式更好地解决知识注入、幻觉、对齐等问题。团队在奥运会国际赛事、海外主权大模型以及国内税务等场景均有行业化落地。  

团队十分欢迎LLM研究及行业应用方向上的**优秀实习生和正式员工**。如果您有兴趣，请随时与我联系。详情请见[Internship页面](http://localhost:4000/internship/)。
